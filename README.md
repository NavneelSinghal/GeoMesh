# Geometrical mesh processing algorithms

This project aims to implement efficient online queries on given triangular mesh.

## Available functionality

Note that all the following queries can be done on the fly.

1. Adding triangles to a mesh.

2. Finding the type of the mesh.

3. Finding all the boundary edges of a mesh.

4. Finding the number of connected components in a mesh.

5. Finding the points, edges, edge neighbours, and vertex neighbours of triangles.

6. Finding the incident triangles, incident edges and adjacent points of a point.

7. Finding the triangles incident to an edge.

8. Finding whether two triangles are connected in the mesh.

9. Finding the maximum diameter of any component (maximum number of triangles on a shortest path between two triangles)

10. Finding the centroid of the largest component which contains a given point.

11. Finding the closest component to the largest component which contains a given point.
